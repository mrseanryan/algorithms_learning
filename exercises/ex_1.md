## problems

1. Give recursive and iterative algorithms that perform preorder and post-order tree walks in O(n) time on a tree of n nodes. 

2. Give recursive and iterative algorithms for finding the max and min of a tree that runs in O(height) on a tree of n nodes.

3. Suppose that we construct a binary search tree by repeatedly inserting distinct values into the tree. 
Argue that the number of nodes examined in searching for a value in the tree is one plus the number of 
nodes examined when the value was first inserted into the tree.

4. We can sort a given set of n numbers by first building a binary search tree containing these numbers 
by inserting numbers one by one and then printing the numbers by an in-order tree walk. 
What are the worst-case and best-case running times for this sorting algorithm? 

5. Implement a Red Black Tree and a Binary Search Tree in your favorite language. 

6. Show that any arbitrary n-node binary search tree can be transformed into any other arbitrary n-node binary search tree using O(n) rotations. (Hint: First show that at most nâˆ’1 right rotations suffice to transform the tree into a right-going chain.)
